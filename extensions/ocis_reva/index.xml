      <description>Installation So far we are offering two different variants for the installation. You can choose between Docker or pre-built binaries which are stored on our download mirrors and GitHub releases.

Configuration We provide overall three different variants of configuration. The variant based on environment variables and commandline flags are split up into global values and command-specific values.</description>
