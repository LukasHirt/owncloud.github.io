      <description>Installation So far we are offering two different variants for the installation. You can choose between Docker or pre-built binaries which are stored on our download mirrors and GitHub releases. Maybe we will also provide system packages for the major distributions later if we see the need for it.
Docker TBD
Binaries TBD
Configuration We provide overall three different variants of configuration. The variant based on environment variables and commandline flags are split up into global values and command-specific values.</description>

      <description>How to build and run ocis-simple ocis uses build tags to build different flavors of the binary. In order to work on a new extension we are going to reduce the scope a little and use the simple tag. Let us begin by creating a dedicated folder:
mkdir ocis-extension-workshop &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ocis-extension-workshop Following https://github.com/owncloud/ocis
git clone https://github.com/owncloud/ocis.git cd ocis TAGS=simple make generate build Q: Can you specify which version of phoenix to use?</description>
